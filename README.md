Some-formula-I-came-up-with...
It was in my math homework (it just asked for the greatest), but I wondered if I could make a formula to output every possible number.
The formula was:


n(subscript 0) - n(subscript infinity) = n - 10x
n = -8; x = the generation that n is on (the value that its subscript has).
